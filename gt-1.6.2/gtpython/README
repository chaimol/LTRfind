This directory contains the GenomeTools Python bindings (requires Python >=2.6)

To use them, you have to add the following line to your Python script:

from gt import *

It is also possible to import single classes from the 'core', 'extended' and
'annotationsketch' sub-packages, e.g.

from gt.extended.feature_node import FeatureNode

Make sure that this directory is added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable.
Alternatively, run

python setup.py install

to install the 'gt' package on this system (must be root).

Furthermore, you have to make sure that the GenomeTools shared libraries can
be found by the dlopen(3) system call. For example, by adding the lib/
subdirectory of GenomeTools to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
Alternatively, use "make install" in the genometools directory for a
system-wide installation of libgenometools.

For examples on how to use these bindings, please refer to the scripts in
the subdirectory testdata/gtpython/ of GenomeTools.

The GenomeTools genome analysis system is a collection of bioinformatics tools
(in the realm of genome informatics) combined into a single binary named ``gt''.
It is based on a C library named ``libgenometools''.

bin/       contains the binary file
doc/       contains some PDF manuals
include/   contains the genometools.h Header (in the genometools/ subdirectory)
gtdata/    data needed by gt (during runtime)
gtruby/    contains GenomeTools Ruby bindings (-> gtruby/README)
gtpython/  contains GenomeTools Python bindings (-> gtpython/README)
lib/       contains the libgenometools (as static and shared library)

The GenomeTools source code can be downloaded from http://genometools.org

For the ``gt'' binary an additional statically linked binary with the same name is contained in the directory bin/static/ (except for Mac OS X).
Please try it, if the dynamically linked binary does not work on your system.

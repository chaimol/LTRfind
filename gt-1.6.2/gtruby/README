This directory contains the GenomeTools Ruby bindings.

To be able to use them, you have to add the following line to your Ruby script:

require 'gtruby'

and make sure that this directory is added to the ruby load-path variable ($:).
Either by calling ruby with the option -I or by adding this directory to the
RUBYLIB environment variable.

Furthermore, you have to make sure that the GenomeTools shared libraries can be
be found by the dlopen(3) system call. For example, by adding the lib/
subdirectory of GenomeTools to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

For examples on how to use these bindings, please refer to the scripts in
the subdirectory testdata/gtruby/ of GenomeTools.
